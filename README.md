# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-validator

Tools for validating Who's On First documents

## Usage

This isn't ready for general purpose usage yet. Once it is it will deprecate and supersede the `wof-validate` script in the [py-mapzen-whosonfirst-utils](https://github.com/whosonfirst/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-utils/) repository.
